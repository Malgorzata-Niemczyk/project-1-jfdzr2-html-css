This was a 4 week long project built during my first module at InfoShare Academy. Project goal included using HTML and CSS to build three responsive webpage layouts.

The layouts I have chosen to build included: a landing page of a restaurant offering traditional food, an on-line shopping cart and a list of products offered by an on-line shop.


One of the main challenges I ran into while working on this project was building the layout 1 that was based quite a lot on CSS Grid as it recquired almost redesigning the webpage for each break point using media queries.
